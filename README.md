# Picture to Program
The Abstraction of Logic: Using Pixels for Code Synthesis
Pixel to Program aims to create a program, a usually thought-out and logical creation, from a picture. While the program works for small pictures (larger pictures create so much code it won't compile due to java resctrictions on class sizes), it still also needs a lot of work on the synthesis of the idea. If the code is essentially random, then why not simply use random values. Future versions might explore shapes inside the picture corresponding to progromatic structures, and other similar correlations.
